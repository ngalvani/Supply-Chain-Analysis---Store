# Supply-Chain-Analysis---Store </br>
This repository contains a supply chain data analysis project designed to derive insights into shipping costs, manufacturing costs, and product sales. Conducted as a solo project, the analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to answer key business questions and showcase data manipulation skills. This dataset is sourced from Kaggle and does not represent a real store. This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset, while not representing a real store, was used to simulate a retail environment. The project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to derive actionable business insights.

# Data Cleaning & Transformation: </br>
**Involved significant data cleaning, including:**</br>

- Addressing inconsistencies in column headers and unit costs.</br>
- Creating new columns to calculate total manufacturing costs and total shipping costs based on per-unit data and production volumes.</br>
- Deleting redundant columns and restructuring the dataset for clarity and usability.</br>

**Analysis Questions Explored:**</br>

**1. SKU Sales Analysis:** _What are the top-selling SKUs (by units sold), and what is their total revenue, grouped by product type?_</br>
**2. Production vs. Sales:** _What is the total production volume compared to the quantity sold for each product type, and how does it correlate with stock levels?_</br>
**3. Shipping Cost Insights:** _How do shipping costs vary across different carriers, and what impact does this have on overall revenue?_</br>
**4. Manufacturing Effeciency Insights:** _How does the manufacturing lead time compare to the manufacturing cost per unit across different carriers?_</br>

# Pivot Tables:<br>

**- SKU-level Sales Performance**</br>
**- Production Efficiency**</br>
**- Carrier-based Shipping Costs**</br> 

# Visualizations:<br>
Analyzed the top-selling SKUs and their contribution to total revenue by product type, examining the correlation between production volumes, quantities sold, and stock levels, and uncovering trends in shipping costs across carriers and their impact on overall revenue performance.</br>

# Findings: </br>

- Identified the top-selling SKUs, with insights into their revenue contributions by product type.</br>
- Observed a clear trend between production volume and stock levels for specific product types, including sold and remaining percentages.</br>
- Highlighted variations in shipping costs by carrier and their significant impact on revenue.</br>


**Key Features of the Project**</br>

- Dataset cleaning and restructuring to correct errors and inconsistencies.</br>
- Creation of new metrics like total manufacturing costs, total shipping costs, and production-to-sold percentages.</br>
- Pivot tables and visualizations for actionable insights into sales, production, and shipping dynamics.</br>

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to clean and analyze raw retail data, answer key business questions, and provide insights on shipping costs, sales, and production efficiency.
